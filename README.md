This README file acts as an Error Log for the Smart Pension company and employee database which highlights the UI errors.

This is achieved by breaking the document into three sections:

- Error
- Causation
- Solution

# Error 1

- In the '/companies' route, when clicking on any 'Show' button within the 'Companies List' page, the title section defaults to the first name existing within the company list.

#### Causation:

- In the "companies_controllers.rb", the defined show method has a Company.first method after retrieving with Company.find method which selects the first id in the companies table.
- The URL shows the id of the company but does not display the respective company name.

#### Solution:

- To fix this issue, remove the Company.first method from the 'show method', so as to retrieve and display the selected company name.

# Error 2

When adding a new employee, it throws the following error: "1 error prohibited this employee from being saved : Surname cannot be blank".

#### Causation:

In the 'new.html.erb' file in the "employees views" folder:

- The label shows "surname", however the textfield attribute shows "middle-name".

#### Solution:

- Add the middlename label with its textfield attribute
- Add the surname label with its textfield attribute

# Error 3

When editing existing employee, the console throws an error: "company id not found".

#### Causation:

- When clicking on a company with: company id = 9 and employee id = 14
- Rails Error Handler displays the error: "Couldnâ€™t find Company with 'id'=14"
- The Rails parameter section logs the following parameters: company_id = 14 and employee_id = 9
- This throws an error as the edit method takes and swaps both the company and employee id parameters.

#### Solution:

- In the "show.html.erb" file of the companies views folder, add the @companies parameter to the edit link

### Documenting my process of debugging the error

- I ran a user experience journey to get familiar with the underlying functionalities of the UI
- Identified the failures of the features not returning the expected behaviour.
- In two of the errors, I found false positives. The last one within the Ruby on Rails console.

### Tools used to debug:

- Rails Console and irb in the shell environment
- Ruby on Rails frontend error console
- Logging the error to the console
- Using the Chrome browser development tools 

### What I could have done better

- Before changing the code
- I should have screenshotted all the features with the pages
- Just so I could compare the difference in each file
- Changing the code, I ended up getting a final error (when clicking save the console shows a missing ID, however the edit or the new input get successfully saved) that was unexpected and I could have spent more time getting to the root cause of that
